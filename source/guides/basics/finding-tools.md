Finding The Right Tool For The Script
-------------------------------------

**TODO: Write-up that explains how to find the correct command/event/tag/... for a script. Should emphasize the `#bot-spam` channel on the Discord and the idea of asking other people for help in `#denizen-lobby`, though also mention the meta docs website.**
NOTE: Probably a good place to mention the sheer massive number of things that Denizen supports (check the output of `!reload`).
