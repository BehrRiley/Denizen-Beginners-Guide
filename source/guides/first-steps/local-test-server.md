Setting Up A Local Test Server
------------------------------

**TODO: Write-up that guides a user through the process of setting up a local test server.**
Notes:
- Should be Windows focused but mention other OS's where applicable
- Should use Paper for simplicity, but also mention Spigot and link to the BuildTools page on the Spigot wiki
- Should include adding in Denizen (including mentioning when to use release builds vs developmental builds)
- Should mention adding Citizens optionally (for servers that use Citizens normally)
